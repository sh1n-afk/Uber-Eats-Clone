# Uber Eats Clone
This project is a clone of the popular food delivery service, Uber-Eats, designed to demonstrate a full-featured web application incorporating complex functionalities similar to those of the original platform. The application allows users to browse restaurants, place orders, and manage profiles through a responsive interface. Built with React on the frontend and Node.js with Express on the backend, it features a GraphQL API for data fetching and mutations, and utilizes MongoDB for database management. Key features include real-time order updates, customer and restaurant management, and a comprehensive backend service handling user authentication, order processing, and notifications. This project exemplifies my capabilities in developing scalable, real-time web applications that provide a sophisticated user experience.
